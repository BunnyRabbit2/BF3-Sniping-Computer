BF3SnipingComputer
==================

A small program used to calculate bullet drop in BF3

I used this to make guesstimating the bullet drop at distance a thing of the past which made sniping douchebags at extreme range much easier. It was quite useful for the most part and interesting to research on mil dots and other such things.
